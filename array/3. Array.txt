Program 1:
    Create an array with the numbers 0 to 10 and an array of strings with names.

Program 2:
    Match the target with the array elements and return the positions matched
        Test Data:
            Input:
            Provide the array elements:
            [1,2,4,5,6,7,8]

            provide the target:
            8

            Output:
            shortest path: 0,5 - 1,7
            other possibilities:
            1,4 - 2,6

Program 3:
    Write a Go program that reads an array of integers (length 7), and replace the first element of the array by a give number and replace each subsequent position of the array by the double value of the previous.
    Sample Output:
        Input the first element of the array:
        5

        Array elements:
        array_nums[0] = 5
        array_nums[1] = 10
        array_nums[2] = 20
        array_nums[3] = 40
        array_nums[4] = 80
        array_nums[5] = 160
        array_nums[6] = 320

Program 4:
    Write a Go program to sort the given array in both ways
        Test Data:
            Input: 8 3 2 1 3 2
            Output : 1 2 2 3 3 8
